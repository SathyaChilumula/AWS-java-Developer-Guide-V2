Creating, Listing, and Deleting |S3| Buckets

    :description: How to create, list, or delete a bucket using the AWS SDK for Java 2.0.

Every object (file) in |S3| must reside within a *bucket*. A bucket represents a collection (container)
of objects. Each bucket must have a unique *key* (name). For detailed information
about buckets and their configuration, see :s3-dg:`Working with Amazon S3 Buckets <UsingBucket>` in
the |s3-dg|.

.. _create-bucket:

Create a Bucket
===============

Build a :aws-java-class-prev:`CreateBucketRequest <services/s3/model/CreateBucketRequest>`
and provide a bucket name. Pass it to the |s3client|'s
:methodname:`createBucket` method. Use the |s3client| to do additional operations
such as listing or deleting buckets as shown in later examples.

See the :sdk-examples-java-s3:`complete example <S3BucketOps.java>` on GitHub.


.. _list-buckets:

List the Buckets
================

Build a :aws-java-class-prev:`ListBucketRequest <services/s3/model/ListBucketRequest>`.
Use the |s3client|'s :methodname:`listBuckets` method to retrieve the list of buckets.
If the request succeeds a :aws-java-class-prev:`ListBucketsResponse <services/s3/model/ListBucketsResponse>`
is returned. Use this response object to retrieve the list of buckets.

.. _delete-bucket:

Delete a Bucket
===============

Before you can delete an |S3| bucket, you must ensure that the bucket is empty or
the service will return an error. If you have a :S3-dg:`versioned bucket <Versioning>`,
you must also delete any versioned objects that are in the bucket.

Delete Objects in a Bucket
--------------------------

Build a :aws-java-class-prev:`ListObjectsV2Request <services/s3/model/ListObjectsV2Request>`
and use the |s3client|'s :methodname:`listObjects`
method to retrieve the list of objects in the bucket. Then use the :methodname:`deleteObject`
method on each object to delete it.

Delete an Empty Bucket
----------------------

Build a :aws-java-class-prev:`DeleteBucketRequest <services/s3/model/DeleteBucketRequest>`
with a bucket name and pass it to the |s3client|'s :methodname:`deleteBucket` method.
