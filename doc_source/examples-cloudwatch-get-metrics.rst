Listing Metrics
===============

To list |cw| metrics, create a :aws-java-class-prev:`ListMetricsRequest
<services/cloudwatch/model/ListMetricsRequest>` and call the |cwclient|'s :methodname:`listMetrics`
method. You can use the :classname:`ListMetricsRequest` to filter the returned metrics by namespace,
metric name, or dimensions.

.. note:: A list of metrics and dimensions that are posted by AWS services can be found within the
   :cw-ug:`Amazon CloudWatch Metrics and Dimensions Reference <CW_Support_For_AWS>` in the |cw-ug|.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/cloudwatch/src/main/java/com/example/cloudwatch/ListMetrics.java
   :lines: 16-20
   :language: java

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/cloudwatch/src/main/java/com/example/cloudwatch/ListMetrics.java
   :lines: 39-77
   :dedent: 8
   :language: java

The metrics are returned in a :aws-java-class-prev:`ListMetricsResponse
<services/cloudwatch/model/ListMetricsResponse>` by calling its :methodname:`getMetrics` method.

The results may be *paged*. To retrieve the next batch of results, call :methodname:`nextToken`
on the response object and use the token value to build a new request object. Then
call the :methodname:`listMetrics` method again with the new request.

See the :sdk-examples-java-cloudwatch:`complete example <ListMetrics.java>` on GitHub.
