   :description: How to change max concurrency configuration by using the AWS SDK for Java.

You can use the
:aws-java-class:`NettyNioAsyncHttpClient <http/nio/netty/NettyNioAsyncHttpClient>`
for asynchronous clients or the
:aws-java-class:`ApacheHttpClient <http/apache/ApacheHttpClient>` for synchronous clients
to set HTTP transport settings. For a full list of options you can set with these clients,
see the :aws-java-class-root:`AWS SDK for Java 2.0 Reference <>`.

Add a dependency on the :code:`netty-nio-client` in your POM to use the
:aws-java-class:`NettyNioAsyncHttpClient <http/nio/netty/NettyNioAsyncHttpClient>`.

Maximum Connections
============================

You can set the maximum allowed number of open HTTP connections by using the
:methodname:`maxConcurrency` method. The :methodname:`maxPendingConnectionAcquires`
method enables you to set the maximum requests allowed to queue up once max concurrency
is reached.

* Default for maxConcurrency: 50

* Default for maxPendingConnectionAcquires: 10_000

.. important::
   Set the maximum connections to the number of concurrent transactions to avoid
   connection contentions and poor performance.

Use the HTTP client builder to have the SDK manage its lifecycle.
The HTTP client will be closed for you when the service client is shut down.

You can also pass the HTTP client directly to the service client if you want to manage
the lifecycle yourself.
