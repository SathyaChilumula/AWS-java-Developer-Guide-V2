AWS SDK for Java 2.0 Developer Guide
#####################################

The |sdk-java| provides a Java API for |AWSlong|. Using the SDK, you can easily build Java
applications that work with |S3|, |EC2|, |DDB|, and more. We regularly add support for new services
to the |sdk-java|. For a list of changes and features in a particular version,
view the `change log`_.

.. _whats_new:

What's New in Version 2.0
=========================

The |sdk-java-v2| is a major rewrite of the version 1.x code base. It's built on top of
Java 8 and adds several frequently requested features. These include support for non-blocking I/O
and the ability to plug in a different HTTP implementation at run time. For more information see
the `AWS Blog`_.

.. important::
   Currently the asynchronous clients for |AKlong|, |DDBlong| and |CWlong| modules in
   version 2.0 are production ready and can be used in production environments.
   All other modules are preview releases and are not recommended for production use.

.. _1.0-support:

Support for 1.0
===============

We are not dropping support for the 1.x versions of the AWS SDK for Java currently.
As we get closer to the final production release, we will share a detailed plan for continued
1.x support, similar to how we rolled out major versions of other AWS SDKs.

.. _eclipse-support:

Eclipse IDE Support
===================

The |tke| doesn't currently support the |sdk-java-v2|. To use the |tke| with
the |sdk-java-v2|, you should use Maven tools in Eclipse to add a dependency on the 2.0 SDK.

.. _android-support:

Developing AWS Applications for Android
=======================================

If you're an Android developer, |AWSlong| publishes an SDK made specifically for Android
development: the |sdk-android|_. See the |sdk-android-dg|_ for the complete documentation.
