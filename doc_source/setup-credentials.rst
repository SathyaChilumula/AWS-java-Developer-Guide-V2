Set Up AWS Credentials and Region for Development

   :description: Set up default AWS credentials and region for development with the AWS SDK for
                 Java.
   :keywords: AWS region, AWS credentials, shared credentials file, shared config file

To connect to any of the supported services with the |sdk-java|, you must provide AWS credentials.
The AWS SDKs and CLIs use :emphasis:`provider chains` to look for AWS credentials in several
different places, including system/user environment variables and local AWS configuration files.

This topic provides basic information about setting up your AWS credentials for local application
development using the |sdk-java|. If you need to set up credentials for use within an |EC2| instance
or if you're using the Eclipse IDE for development, see the following topics instead:

* When using an EC2 instance, create an IAM role and then give your EC2 instance access to that role
  as shown in :doc:`java-dg-roles`.

* Set up AWS credentials within Eclipse using the |tke|_. See :tke-ug:`Set up AWS Credentials
  <setup-credentials>` in the |tke-ug|_.

Setting AWS Credentials
=======================

You can set your credentials for use by the |sdk-java| in several ways. However, these are
the recommended approaches:

.. include:: common/sdk-shared-credentials.txt

Once you set your AWS credentials using one of these methods, the |sdk-java| loads them automatically
by using the default credential provider chain. For more information about
working with AWS credentials in your Java applications, see :doc:`credentials`.

.. _setup-credentials-setting-region:

Setting the AWS Region
======================

You should set a default AWS Region to use for accessing AWS services with the |sdk-java|. For the best
network performance, choose a region that's geographically close
to you (or to your customers).

.. note:: If you *don't* select a region, service calls that require a region will fail.

You can use techniques similar to those for setting credentials to set your default AWS Region:

.. The following file is in the shared content at https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-shared-content

.. include:: common/sdk-shared-region.txt

For information about selecting a region, see :doc:`java-dg-region-selection`.
